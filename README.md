# UK NOTAM Archive
An hourly updated archive of all UK Notices To Airmen (NOTAM), along with all other pre-flight information bulletins (PIB).

The data is fetched from the [NATS AIS Contingency system](https://www.nats.aero/do-it-online/pre-flight-information-bulletins/) as it provides the feeds without authentication.

Forked from [Jonty/uk-notam-archive](https://github.com/Jonty/uk-notam-archive) to act as my own archive for my projects.

NATS says: ``The above file contains all UK NOTAM valid at the time of generation and within the next 7 days, it is provided by the EAD system with no declared xml schema and therefore may be subject to change with minimal notification.``
